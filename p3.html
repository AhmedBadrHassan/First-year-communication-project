        <h3>Dairies</h3>
        <p>Dairy foods are made from the milk of animals such as cows, sheep, goats,
             and even camels and buffalo. Milk is processed in particular ways to create
              types of food that are the central part of many cuisines around the world. </p><br>
            <p>
            The most well-known dairy product is cow’s milk. This common food can be sold
             full-fat, semi-skimmed, or skimmed, depending on the fat content. Cream is a
              by-product of milk and this can be used to make butter or whipped up to use 
              in desserts or fill pastries. </p><br>
              <p>
            One healthy type of dairy product is plain or natural yogurt. This is a fermented
             milk product that contains healthy bacteria. Natural yogurt is a popular accompaniment 
             to many Turkish dishes, as well as being common in Moroccan and Mediterranean dishes.
              Milk kefir is a type of yogurt drink that is popular in Eastern European and Russian
               cuisine. </p><br>

    <h3>Eggs</h3>
    
    <p>Eggs and dairy are animal products and high in protein. 
        However, eggs are not considered a dairy product, as dairy 
        is produced from milk whereas eggs come from birds.
         Also, non-fertilized eggs are not considered meat as they 
         don’t involve animal flesh used for eating. This is why eggs 
         are a food category by themselves. </p><br>
         <p>
           Eggs are commonly used in baking, quiches and omelettes, and
         are very versatile type of food. Eggs can be consumed boiled,
          fried, poached, scrambled and even raw such as in mayonnaise 
          and eggnog drink. </p><br>
          <p>
        The Italian pasta carbonara is a delicious pasta dish made with egg,
         hard cheese, cured meat, and black pepper. The Tunisian egg brik is
          a popular dish where a whole egg is wrapped in a triangular pastry 
          pocket with various fillings. </p><br>
