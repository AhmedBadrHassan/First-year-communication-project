        <h3>Vegetables</h3>
        <p>Vegetables are some of the most important foods we need to consume regularly.
             Vegetables are divided into a number of subcategories. There are root vegetables,
              bulb vegetables, stem, leafy, and podded vegetables. </p><br>
              <p>
            Root vegetables are some of the most commonly consumed plants.
             In many cultures, potatoes are an important source of carbohydrates.
              Potatoes can be boiled, fried, sauteed, or mashed. </p><br>
            <p>
            Bulbous vegetables are also important foods in nearly every type of cuisine.
             Chopped garlic or onions are often fried gently and form the basis of many French,
              Chinese, Indian, and Mediterranean dishes. 
            </p><br>
            <p>
            Stem vegetable like bamboo shoots is used extensively in Asian cooking.
             European and North American cuisine use stem vegetables such as asparagus and celery. </p><br>

    <h3>Fruit</h3>
    
    <p>Fruits are not just delicious but they are also healthy.
         Different types of fruit are common in all food cultures.
          Fruits can be divided into various categories such as tropical,
           citrus, drupes, berries, pomes, and pepos. </p><br>
          <p>
        There are also some types of fruit that we commonly think of as vegetables
         or savory foods. For example, avocados, olives, and tomatoes are botanically
          ‘fruits’ commonly used as part of a main meal, not a dessert. </p><br>
        <p>
        Various types of fruit should be an important part of everyone’s diet as they contain vitamins,
         minerals, and fiber. Even the humble apple is a storehouse of goodness. </p><br>
         <p>
        One of the best ways to get all the healthy goodness from fruits is by juicing
         or blending them. Putting a banana, some blueberries, or any other kind of fruit with
          plain yogurt and milk in a blender can create a healthy fruit smoothie. </p><br>
