        <h3>Meats</h3>
        <p>There are very few cultures where meat and poultry are not important types of food.
            Some animals such as cows, chickens, and lamb are raised specifically for their meat.
             Others, such as game birds, wild boar, rabbits, and deer, are often hunted. For cooking,
              meat can be minced, cut into chops, diced, sliced, or roasted as large cuts. </p><br>
              <p>
           Many food cultures also include cured meats in their culinary delicacies. For example, 
           Spain has dry-cured Jamon or Serrano ham, Italy has Parma ham, and in American cuisine,
            bacon is a popular breakfast staple. </p><br>
           <p>
           In many Western countries, one of the best kinds of food to eat is a rare to medium cooked
            steak. Even though Westerners tend to eat too much red meat such as beef and pork, hamburgers,
             meatballs and sausages are popular meal choices. </p><br>

    <h3>Seafood</h3>
        <p>Seafood is another important type of food.
             This food type includes fish, shellfish such as crab and lobster,
              and squid or octopus. Most types of fish sold in shops are caught at sea.
               However, fish farming is also a common way to raise salmon, carp,
                rainbow trout, mussels, oysters, and clams. </p><br>
                <p>

            Most countries that have coastal regions have a distinct fish culture.
             For example, in Mediterranean countries, whole grilled, baked,
              or steamed fish is often on the menu. Also, deep-fried squid rings are popular
               as an appetizer and are even sold in fast-food restaurants. </p><br>
               <p>
            In Asian countries, people tend to eat more fish than meat. For example, in Thai
             cuisine, green fish curry is a popular choice. Also, Chinese dishes include pan-fried
              fish or steamed fish in Cantonese cuisine. </p><br>
